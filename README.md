##Fall Semester
Period 5
###Main Projects
####[Query Website](https://github.com/voidyknight/Questions)
(feat. Me, Leon, Anish, Edison)
#####A website that lets you ask a question and receive an answer.
Our project uses a pared-down regex to search for either names or dates, depending on the type of query, and returns whatever name or date appears the most.  
####[An SQLite Blog](https://github.com/fawnwong/SQLiteBlogs)
(feat. Me, Fawn, Christopher, Dionys (???))
#####A very simple blog.
The website comprises a single, hopefully linear set of posts, each containing a title, author, and body, as well as several comments related to the post.
